# Utilitech Glass Break Detector with SmartThings

Instructions for pairing the Utilitech Glass Break Detector to the Samsung SmartThings network, along with adding code that will will automatically detect newly paired sensors.

### Pairing

You can reset these devices by leaving the batteries in and pressing the outside button 5 times, about one press per second. After you do that, you are going to see blinking followed by a long blink before the light goes out. Wait until all the activity on the lights has stopped, then press the button once and it will start blinking a few times with a pause and then repeat. At that point, you can pair the device. It will only stay in that mode for maybe 15-30 seconds, so if it doesn't pick up the first time, just press the button a single time to get it searching again.

### Add Device to SmartThings

This code will create a new device (ST_UtilitechGlassBreak) to the system.
1. Go to `My Device Handlers`
2. Click `Create New Device Handler`
3. Click `From Code`
4. Copy and paste this code in the text field
